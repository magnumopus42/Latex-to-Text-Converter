Hi world.

This is a sample text. We %attempt% to
show that our %Latex% code works
The above should have been substituted
We begin with $$alpha$$ and $$beta$$ and $$gamma$$.
The above was latexed.

Text before should stay on this line $$$frac abc b$$$ and text after goes down 2 lines
The above was put on a new line and centered latex style. 


Then we do nothing.
#nothing 
#nothing
#nothing
$$$alpha$$$

This is test 1 which shows comments
varsub and our latex code works:
$$times$$ and $$cdot$$


$$int ab c$$

$$$int ab cdefg$$$

We are done. Commence test 2 with in.txt2.
