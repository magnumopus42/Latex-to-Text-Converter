Hi world.
This is a sample text. We success to
show that our python code works
The above should have been substituted
We begin with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
The above was latexed.
Text before should stay on this line 
$$\frac{abc}{b}$$
 and text after goes down 2 lines
The above was put on a new line and centered latex style. 
Then we do nothing.

$$\alpha$$

This is test 1 which shows comments
varsub and our latex code works:
$\times$ and $\cdot$
$\int_{ab}^{c}$

$$\int_{ab}^{cdefg}$$

We are done. Commence test 2 with in.txt2.
