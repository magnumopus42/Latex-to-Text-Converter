We already showed %Latex%, substitution
and frac and int. We now show a list:
<
hi
how are
you
>

That was a list.
Now a nested list:
<
hi
$$frac a bcdef$$
%Latex% works inside the list which is good
$$int ab c$$
$$alpha$$
<
how are you
>
>

<
This semester was fun.
I hope we get on campus
%soon% soon.
